# Reading List and Notes for Weed Detection ML/CV and Herbicide Resistance
This respository contains a list of all the papers and respositories I've read by month with the relevant notes for any machine learning and computer vision concepts related to weed detection and herbicide resistance. There is likely to be a specific focus on deep learning with additional sections on herbicide resistance management. The target is to read and take notes on 30 new papers per month, or roughly one per day.

The links below direct to the notes and the original source of the paper from whichever publisher is used. The archiv link is provided where relevant.
